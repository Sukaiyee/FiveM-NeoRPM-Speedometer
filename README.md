# NeoRPM
A speedometer script for FiveM that took some inspiration from NoPixel


This Speedometer has KMH and MPH support it can be toggled with the U key
it also has support for showing and hiding icons in different classes, such as cycles helicopters ect. 

This is something that's super basic. it was never meant as a full time project
